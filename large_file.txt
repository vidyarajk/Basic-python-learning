Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. Coming from a humble background, he sold newspapers as a boy to support his family. He studied aeronautical engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology.

He went on to become one of India’s top aerospace scientists, working with ISRO and DRDO, where he led the development of key space and missile projects. He became known as the "Missile Man of India."

In 2002, he was elected as the 11th President of India, serving until 2007. He was widely loved for his humility, patriotism, and connection with young people. After his presidency, he focused on education, traveling the country to inspire students.

He passed away on July 27, 2015, while giving a lecture at IIM Shillong — a fitting end for someone who lived to teach and inspire.
